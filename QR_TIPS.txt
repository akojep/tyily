QR TATTOO TIPS
- Use a short URL (or a branded short link) so the QR pattern is less dense.
- Export QR with high error correction (level H) and include a white quiet zone border.
- Print a 2Ã—2 inch test sticker and verify it scans from multiple phones before tattooing.
- Avoid placing the tattoo where skin stretches heavily (inner elbow, knuckle creases).
- Keep the QR solid black on white for maximum contrast; no inverted colors.
